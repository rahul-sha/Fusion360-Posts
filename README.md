# Fusion360-Posts
Collection of Posts I use in Fusion 360. So far only have for fanuc 0i-MD.
Very novice at JS, I just fiddled around. Try it at your own risk.

For fanuc-0I-MD (modded-2403), Here are the changes made to the generic fanuc post from Fusion 360 Library:
- Program name in the next line.
- Time Stamp for when the file is post.
- Simplified Description of tool list.

- Sequence numbers according to tool change. (Hopefully)
- M09, M01 occur before the tool change and the next operation.

- Removed tool comment and instead use tool type as an indicator for each operation.

For fanuc-0I-MD (modded-1304),
- Removed P or dwell time value from tapping and drill operations due to personal preference.
