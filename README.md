# Fusion360-Posts
Collection of Posts I use in Fusion 360.
Very novice at JS, I just fiddled around. Try it at your own risk.

For Fanuc 0i-MD, Here are the changes made to the generic fanuc post from Fusion 360 Library:
- Program name in the next line.
- Simplified Description of tool list.

- Sequence numbers according to tool change. (Hopefully)
- M09, M01 occur before the tool change and the next operation.

- Removed tool comment and instead use tool type as an indicator for each operation.
